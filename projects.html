We also asked their gender. The genders of the students are almost 50-50, there might be a mistake in the system, because all the students didn't respond. But there was little more boys.

First, we played a game of bingo to get to know each other.

What is bingo actually?

For us, bingo is an exchange of information, something we play in class after a vacatcion to find out what the others have been up to. Afterwards we did a tour of the school. Quite normal for us, right? But the Finns seemed very enthusiastic and interested. After the tour we had an introduction to our project. The different interests became clear there. We were divided into two groups. The first group dealt with the design of the website, the other group dealt with the content of the website. At the end of the school day, we cooked potato salad and meatballs together. Something traditionally german.

We are looking forward to a great day together.
Today at school we invited an expert for journalism: Petra. For the first period we discussed about what to fill out website with and how to make it interesting. Do you know how to write a catchy blog entry? We do now! It should start with an appealing beginning. Throughout the blog it should be like a conversation, a little interaction with the reader. Later we came up with 6 questions about phone using for our survey and split up into groups for tomorrow. How many hours do you spent on your phone everyday?
In the last period we went in an actionbound tour through Potsdam prepared by Milena and Linnea. After 6km and two hours we have seen about 6 of the most famous sights like the Pfingstberg, neuer Garten, Marmor Palace or the holländisches Viertel and ended the tour there. There are so many things to see in Potsdam!!
Today is Wednesday, 25 September. Today we conducted a survey about mobile phone use throughout the school. 
Why are we doing this? 
We want to know how much time we spend on our mobile phones and for what. We also asked the students  these questions. Then we analysed the results of the survey and drew a conclusion. Because let's be honest, we all use our mobile phones very often. But is that necessary? We should ask ourselves that.
After lunch, we developed our own Erasmus logos together and then printed or painted them on shirts using the screen printing technique. 
Do you know what screen printing is?  
Screen printing is a printing technique in which colour is transferred through a screen onto a T-shirt, for example. You need a stencil for this,…

It's Day 1 of our exchange in Potsdam. After an eventful day at school full of new people we separated into smaller groups and went to explore the city
During our walk in the park we saw huge beautiful trees that were nothing like in Kalajoki. The surroundings reminded us of all the fantasy books we've read: ancient ruins, enormous trees, a big palace with an impressive fountain. The most fun we had was when racing down a hill laughing smiling and almost falling. The atmosphere was light, bright and free. 
Continuing our walk into the center we saw beautiful buildings, that reminded us about France and Italy.  There were plenty of little shops that we visited and purchased some souvenirs. The town is wonderful even though it is so much different from Kalajoki and what we are used to.
After a beautiful excursion in the city, we went to have some refreshing ice cream in the city centre. It is always nice to walk in a city that big and charming. Our journey continued into a cosy welcoming place: to my host's house, where our friends and us had dinner. Even though it was only the second day, we already felt comfortable and open next to our new friends. We spent the rest of the evening singing, dancing, smiling and laughing together, leaving through something that now has become one of my favourite memories from the trip. "Umbrella" by Rihanna is still playing in my head and all these happy and warm pictures of our evening pop up at the same time.
Wednesday, 25th
In the afternoon will happen something special! We'll screenprint something on the t-shirts! We've no idea how we'll do it, because most of us have never done that before. It's brilliant idea that we'll create a design ourselves and we'll get t-shirts as a souvenir from Germany! We get to know each other much better with common activities. 
The thing that we started to plan on paper is was an Erasmus logo! I've always wanted to try to draw on t-shirt, but that's was even more smaizing experience! Firstlty our teacher told us about types of logos. We got to know how many options we actually had! We could draw the things that reminder us of Germany or our own experience in general.
We had an brainstorm in our head while we're thinking…

Conclusion of the survey

<br>
<br>
Most teenagers these days agree that phones and technological devices shouldn't be handed easily to kids as they are still in a developing phase of their life and the time spent on the phones for most of them causes an addiction. Teenagers expressed that the absence of technologic devices bring them happiness, and they feel relaxed more than feeling anxious or stressed. That shows us that on a daily basis, phones and technological devices can tire us out. Among teens, phones are used mostly for communication and the usage of social media.

	 <strong>From Northern Lights to Finnish Delights: An Unforgettable Start in Kalajoki</strong>
<br>
<br>	
		
Sunday felt like a dream. It was our first day with our host families, and we kicked it off by visiting a shopping center with a few other families. We shared laughs over a meal at Helburger, then spent the afternoon playing board games and bonding at a host family's house.
<br>
But the highlight? On the way home, the northern lights lit up the sky—a rare sight in Kalajoki, appearing only for the 4th time all winter. The colors danced above us, turning an already amazing day into something truly unforgettable.
<br>
On Monday, we stepped into the Finnish school, Lukio, and it was absolutely magical! The teachers welcomed us with so much warmth and guided us through an amazing week. We kicked things off with fun Icebreakers and team games that brought everyone closer. In the evening, a few of us got to bake traditional Finnish desserts. The perfect start to an unforgettable week.
<br>
<br>

 <strong>Dienstag mit Nightmares und Eis</strong> 
<br>
<br>
 
Am Dienstag startete der Tag mit einem Treffen von Schülern aus Italien, Brasilien, Deutschland, Finnland und anderen Ländern. Nach der Vorstellung unserer Schule haben wir über „Finnish Nightmares“ und „Deutsche Albträume“ gesprochen. „Finnish Nightmares“ Comics zeigen witzige Alltagshorrorszenen, wie Smalltalk mit Fremden oder zu nah stehende Menschen. Dazu haben wir eigene Comics zu „Deutschen Albträumen“ gestaltet und diese den „Finnish Nightmares“ gegenübergestellt.
<br>

 
Danach ging's mit den Finnen aufs Eis: Schlittschuhlaufen, Eishockey spielen und nebenbei noch einen Geburtstag feiern. Zum Abschluss des Schultages besuchten wir ein Museum über eine alte finnische Familie - angeblich spukt es da immer noch! Den Rest des Tages verbrachten die Schüler mit Spielen, Sport und Shoppen.
<br>
<br>
 
 
 
 

<strong>Mittwoch: Der Schnee verwandelt Finnland in ein Wintermärchen</strong>
<br>
<br>
 
Der Mittwoch brachte Abwechslung und Spaß: Nach der Arbeit an unseren Projekten in der Schule spielten wir ein ungewöhnliches Gemeinschaftsspiel, bei dem wir Türme aus Spaghetti und Klebeband bauen mussten. Es war überraschend unterhaltsam und stärkte unseren Teamgeist.
<br>
Am Nachmittag ging nahmen wir an einer Winter Olympia teil , wo wir in Zweierteams spielerisch gegeneinander antraten. Diese Herausforderungen brachten uns noch näher mit unseren finnischen Austauschpartner*innen zusammen.
<br>
 
 
Den Abend verbrachte jeder individuell obsleepover, beim Bowling, in der Sauna oder bei Outdoor-Aktivitäten. Der frisch gefallene Schnee verwandelte Finnland in das was wir uns unter Finnland vorgestellthaben: verschneit, stimmungsvoll und voller Erlebnisse, die noch lang in Erinnerung bleiben werden.  
<br>
<br>
 

<strong>Donnerstag:</strong>
<br>
<br>
 
 
Zuerst haben wir weiter an unserem Erasmusprojekt gearbeitet. Danach durften wir im Unterricht unserer finnischen Gastschüler teilnehmen.
<br>
(Wir konnten viele Ähnlichkeiten zu unserem deutschen Schulsystem erkennen. Zudem war der Unterricht mit viel mehr technischen Geräten gestützt, was uns sehr begeistert hat) 
<br>
 
 
Am Nachmittag sind wir alle zu einem Youth-House gegangen. Dort haben wir zusammen Billiard, Tischtennis und Karten gespielt, Kekse gegessen, Musik gehört und einen schönen Nachmittag zusammen verbracht :)
<br>
<br>
 
 
 

<strong>Our last day in finland: </strong>
<br>
<br>
 
After the sauna, we went home and had something to eat. Later in the afternoon we went to the coast of Kalajoki. There we went for a walk in the snow. It was really nice to walk through the snow that crunches under your feet. What a nice sound. In the evening we had to pack our bags because we were going back to Potsdam tomorrow. 
 
<br>
 
It was a wonderful time in Finland with lots of new impressions and new memories. It was a great chance to get to know new people and make new friends. All in all, Erasmus + is a great experience and we would recommend to others.  
<br>
 
 
Thank you Erasmus+ for this wonderful time!
