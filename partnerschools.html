	    One from the three partner schools is the Colegio Salesiano San Juan Bosco. In Moron de la Frontera near Sevilla in Spain. It's a private school. 
		The students from the 9th grade have the chance to visit Spain. The students live with host families for one week and the project language is English. 
		The project is suported by Erasmus+. The students work on different projects every year.  In 2022 the projects were "A clean world" and "2022-today". In that same year, we received a climate award from Potsdam for the project "A clean world".

					About the school:
				</h6>
					<h6 class="tekstindiv">
						   The school is quite small, with about 30 teachers and 250 students. A quarter of these students come from outside Kalajoki. The school is a "sock school", meaning the students do not wear shoes inside. Lessons are 1 hour and 30 minutes long, with a short break in between. Students can choose a specific track that includes more lessons in a particular subject. For example, students in the visual arts track have more art lessons. In this school, students have an "exam week" during which they focus solely on exams without any other lessons.
